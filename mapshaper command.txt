mapshaper csd2021.shp -require simp_length.js alias=_ -simplify variable percentage='_.percentage(this)' weighted weighting=1 stats keep-shapes -proj wgs84 -o simplified.length.shp


mapshaper conditional simplification:
https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/issues/154

To use this feature, add the variable flag to the -simplify command, and pass an expression as the value of resolution=, percentage= or interval= instead of a literal value. The expression could be the name of a data field that contains the simplification value for each feature, a ternary expression, or another expression of the kind used by the -each command. 

Example

-simplify variable resolution='this.area < 1e8 ? 20000 : 10000'
